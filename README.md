# custom-hook-context-fetch-api-reactjs
Provides a custom React hook that facilitates making API requests and managing data fetching state using a context API

## Introduction
Fetching data from APIs is a common task in React applications, which involves handling asynchronous operations. This can become difficult, particularly when dealing with multiple components that require access to the fetched data. To make this process simpler, React provides two powerful features: custom hooks and context.
Custom hooks are a powerful feature in React that allow developers to encapsulate reusable logic and data fetching logic into functions that can be easily accessed from different parts of their application without having to repeat the same code. This makes it possible to create complex applications with ease and efficiency. 

Context API is another valuable feature in React that enables you to share data between components in a hierarchical manner. This means that data can be accessed by multiple components without having to pass it down through props, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. 

Combining custom hooks with Context API is an excellent way to fetch data from an API and share it across multiple components. This approach makes it easy to manage and reuse data fetching logic while ensuring that the data is available to all the components that need it.
